    <h1>Anuradha Reddy</h1>
    <h2>Senior Architect</h2>
    <ul>
<li>I graduated from UVCE, Bangalore University, in 2005 and have since built a strong foundation in architecture and interior design through extensive industry experience.</li><br>
<li>I Had the opportunity to work with renowned architects such as Nagendra (Artforms), Sagar Shetty (Living Form), and Shreelakshmi (Vivid Creations), contributing to a wide range of residential, commercial, and interior projects.</li><br>
<li>This diverse exposure has shaped my design perspective and strengthened my creative capabilities. My experience, passion, and dedication led to the establishment of my own design studio — Th!nk Des!gn Architects.</li><br>
