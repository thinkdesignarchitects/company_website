    <h2>Our Services</h2>
    <p>We render Architectural Design and Interior Design Consulting services, charged on either per sq. ft. of super-built-up area/carpet area which includes the fixed number of site visits that we will undertake during the course of the project execution.<br><br>
      A quote can only be provided for Architectural Design, Interior Design and Project Management Consulting Services. However, a quote for execution of the project can only be arrived at after finalization of design by the customer.<br><br>
      Contract quotes will be based on the bill of quantities arrived at after the design has been frozen. However, in certain cases, the cost of the project can be arrived at if the super built-up area of the project is known at the time of project initiation.<br><br>
      The payment schedule will be enumerated in our professional fee quote document and generally split into 4 to 5 stages that are spread out through the total duration of the project.</p>
